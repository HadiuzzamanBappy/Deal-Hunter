# PROJECT CONTEXT: DEAL HUNTER AI

## Project Goal
To build a product search aggregator website named "Deal Hunter AI". The site allows users to search for a product and see results from both global e-commerce APIs (like eBay) and scraped local websites (like Daraz in Bangladesh). An AI (Google Gemini) provides a summary of the best deals found across all sources. The application also features a comprehensive favorites system allowing users to save, manage, and compare products across searches.

## High-Level User Flow
### Search & Discovery Flow
- User enters a search term and selects a country using the enhanced SearchBar with smart suggestions.
- Frontend sends the search term and country to the backend.
- Backend initiates parallel searches: one via the eBay API, and another via a Puppeteer scraper if the country is "Bangladesh".
- The results are combined and processed.
- The combined list is sent to the Google Gemini API for an intelligent summary.
- The backend returns a single JSON object containing the combined product list and the AI summary.
- Frontend displays the AI summary and the list of products, with badges indicating their source (eBay or Daraz).

### Favorites Management Flow
- User can add/remove products to/from favorites using heart-shaped buttons on product cards.
- Each user gets a unique auto-generated ID stored in localStorage.
- Favorite products are saved persistently and detected across different searches.
- Users can view all favorites in a dedicated page with price comparison and management features.
- Navigation between search and favorites views is seamless via header controls.

## Technology Stack & Structure
- **Root Directory:** `deal-hunter-app/`
- **Backend (`/backend`):**
  - Language: Node.js with Express.js, using ES Modules.
  - Structure: Modular (routes, controllers, services).
  - `server.js`: Main entry point. Sets up server, middleware, and connects all routers (search, suggestions, favorites).
  - `routes/searchRoutes.js`: Defines the POST /api/search endpoint.
  - `routes/suggestionRoutes.js`: Defines endpoints for smart search suggestions and trending searches.
  - `routes/favoritesRoutes.js`: Defines endpoints for favorites management (add, remove, toggle, check status).
  - `controllers/searchController.js`: Manages the search request flow. Calls necessary services in parallel and combines results.
  - `controllers/suggestionController.js`: Manages search suggestion recording and retrieval.
  - `controllers/favoritesController.js`: Manages all favorites operations with proper error handling.
  - `services/ebayService.js`: Handles all communication with the eBay Finding API.
  - `services/darazService.js`: Handles all web scraping logic using Puppeteer. This is a fragile component that depends on Daraz's HTML structure.
  - `services/geminiService.js`: Handles all communication with the Google Gemini API to generate summaries.
  - `services/searchSuggestionService.js`: Manages persistent search suggestions and trending analysis.
  - `services/favoritesService.js`: Handles favorites storage, product identification, and comparison logic.
  - `data/`: Directory containing JSON files for persistent storage (suggestions.json, favorites.json).
  - `.env` file: Contains EBAY_SANDBOX_APP_ID, GEMINI_API_KEY, and PORT.

- **Frontend (`/frontend`):**
  - Library: React (created with Create React App).
  - **Main Components:**
    - `App.js`: The main component. Manages global state including current view (search/favorites), search parameters, and results. Handles navigation between views.
    - `Header.js`: Enhanced header with theme toggle, favorites navigation, and responsive controls.
    - `SearchBar.js`: Modern search interface with country selection and enhanced styling.
    - `SmartSearchInput.js`: Intelligent search input with auto-complete, trending suggestions, and user history.
    - `Results.js`: Displays AI analysis and product grid with interactive favorite buttons and clean card design.
    - `Favorites.js`: Dedicated favorites management page with comparison features and navigation back to search.
    - `TrendingSearches.js`: Shows popular search terms with click-to-search functionality.
    - `SearchDemo.js`: Interactive demo section for new users.
  - **Services:**
    - `services/userService.js`: Manages user identification and preferences via localStorage.
    - `services/favoritesService.js`: Handles all favorites API calls and product identification.
  - **Context:**
    - `context/ThemeContext.js`: Global theme management (light/dark mode).
    - `context/AuthContext.js`: Authentication context for future user management.

- **Containerization (`/`):**
  - `docker-compose.yml`: Defines and orchestrates the backend and frontend services. Manages port mapping and uses volumes for live-reloading during development.
  - `backend/Dockerfile`: Builds the backend container. Includes a crucial RUN apk add ... command to install system dependencies for Puppeteer/Chromium.
  - `frontend/Dockerfile`: Builds the frontend development server container.
